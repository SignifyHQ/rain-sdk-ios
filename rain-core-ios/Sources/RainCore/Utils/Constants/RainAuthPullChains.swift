/// The chains Rain's Auth Pull runs on, grouped by environment.
///
/// Rain's operator address and USDC contract both differ between sandbox and production, and the
/// two sets of chains do not overlap. Approving on a chain from the wrong environment therefore
/// produces a perfectly valid allowance that no authorization will ever draw on — and on a mainnet
/// chain it spends real gas to grant a real spend allowance to an address Rain does not use there.
/// The approval path rejects that pairing up front (see `RainSdkManager+Approvals`).
///
/// This answers for an *environment*. What a built SDK will actually accept is narrower — the
/// host's ``RainAuthPullConfig`` intersected with the chains that have an RPC endpoint — and is
/// exposed as ``RainSdk/authPullChainIds`` / ``RainClient/authPullChainIds``. Gate UI on those;
/// reach for the static sets only before an SDK exists, and never keep a third copy of the list,
/// which is how these drift apart.
///
/// **Maintenance**
/// In-tree like `TokenRegistry`, so the SDK owns updates. Rain is actively adding chains to the
/// beta; edit this file and ship a release. The matching USDC entries live in `TokenRegistry`, and
/// `RainAuthPullChainsTests` enforces that every chain here has one.
